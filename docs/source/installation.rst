Installation
************

Recommended method
==================
We recommend using the `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution.
Alternative installation instructions are given at the bottom.

WPS/WRF-SFIRE
-------------
Please follow the instructions on `OpenWFM <http://www.openwfm.org>`_ to run WPS/WRF with real data.
Ensure that you have working WPS/WRF installation is available and compatible with the MPI on your cluster.
Note that *wrfxpy* will not modify the WPS/WRF installation, instead for each job, it will clone their directories
into its workspace.

.. attention::

  Past this point, you should be able to run a fire simulation yourself,
  that is have a working ``WPS/WRF-SFIRE`` installation including ``WPS-GEOG``
  and fuels/topography downloaded.  You should be able to submit a parallel
  job into your cluster/supercomputer to run ``wrf.exe``


Python and packages
-------------------
Download and install the Python 3 `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution for your platform.  We recommend an installation into the users home directory.

::

  wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
  chmod +x Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
  ./Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh

We recomend the creation of an environtment. Install pre-requisites: 

::

  conda create -n wrfxpy python=3 netcdf4 pyproj paramiko dill scikit-learn scikit-image h5py psutil proj4
  conda activate wrfxpy
  conda install -c conda-forge simplekml pygrib f90nml pyhdf xmltodict basemap
  pip install MesoPy
  pip install python-cmr

Add your environment (~/.custom.csh) the following line
  setenv PROJ_LIB "$HOME/anaconda3/share/proj"
or if you are using bash to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc
  export PROJ_LIB="$HOME/anaconda3/share/proj"

Note that ``conda`` and ``pip`` are package managers available in the Anaconda Python distribution.

wrfxpy
------

Next, clone the *wrfxpy* code:

::
  
  git clone https://github.com/openwfm/wrfxpy.git

configuration
-------------

And finally, a ``etc/conf.json`` file must be created with the keys discussed below.  A template file ``etc/conf.json.initial`` is provided as a starting point.

Configure the system directories, ``WPS/WRF-SFIRE`` locations and workspace locations by editing the following keys:

::

  "workspace_path": "wksp"
  "wps_install_path": "path/to/WPS"
  "wrf_install_path": "path/to/WRF"
  "sys_install_path": "/path/to/wrfxpy"
  "wps_geog_path" : "/path/to/wps-geogrid"

Optionally, the *wrfxpy* installation can be connected to a visualization server `wrfxweb <https://github.com/vejmelkam/wrfxweb>`_.  The following keys are all optional (and only used if the postprocessed results of simulations are uploaded).

::

  "shuttle_ssh_key": "path/to/your/priv_ssh_key/to/remote/host",
  "shuttle_remote_user" : "remote_username",
  "shuttle_remote_host" : "remote_hostname",
  "shuttle_remote_root" : "remote directory for output storage"

This concludes the ``etc/conf.json`` file.

Next, *wrfxpy* needs to know how jobs are submitted on your cluster.  Create an entry for your cluster, here we use ``speedy`` as an example::

  {
    "speedy" : {
      "qsub_cmd" : "qsub",
      "qsub_script" : "etc/qsub/speedy.sub"
    }
  }

And then the file ``etc/qsub/speedy.sub`` should contain a submission script template, that makes use of the following variables supplied by *wrfxpy* based on job configuration:

* ``%(nodes)d`` the number of nodes requested
* ``%(ppn)d`` the number of processors per node requested
* ``%(wall_time_hrs)d`` the number of hours requested
* ``%(exec_path)d`` the path to the wrf.exe that should be executed
* ``%(cwd)d`` the job working directory
* ``%(task_id)d`` a task id that can be used to identify the job
* ``%(np)d`` the total number of processes requested, equals ``nodes`` x ``ppn``

Note that not all keys need to be used, as shown in the ``speedy`` example::

  #$ -S /bin/bash
  #$ -N %(task_id)s
  #$ -wd %(cwd)s
  #$ -l h_rt=%(wall_time_hrs)d:00:00
  #$ -pe mpich %(np)d
  mpirun_rsh -np %(np)d -hostfile $TMPDIR/machines %(exec_path)s

The script template should be derived from a working submission script.

Note: wrfxpy has already configuration for colibri, gross, kingspeak, and cheyenne.

tokens
-------------

When running wrfxpy, sometimes the data needs to be accessed and downloaded using a specific token created for the user. For instance, in the case of running the Fuel Moisture Model, one needs a token from a valid `MesoWest <https://simplekml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ user to download data automatically. Also, when downloading satellite data, one needs a token from an `Earthdata <https://earthdata.nasa.gov/>`_ user. All of these can be specified with the creation of the file etc/tokens.json from the template etc/tokens.json.initial containing:

::
 
  {
    "mesowest" : "token-from-mesowest",
    "appkey" : "token-from-earthdata"
  }

So, if any of the previous capabilities are required, create a token from the specific page, do

::
 
 cp etc/tokens.json.initial etc/tokens.json

and include your previously created token.

For running fuel moisture model, a new MesoWest user can be created in `MesoWest New User <https://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/my_join.cgi?came_from=http://mesowest.utah.edu>`_. Then, the token can be acquiered and replaced in the etc/tokens.json file.

For acquiring satellite data, a new Earthdata user can be created in `Earthdata New User <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new>`_. Then, the token can be acquiered and replaced in the etc/tokens.json file. There are some data centers that need to be accessed using the $HOME/.netrc file. Therefore, creating the $HOME/.netrc file is recommended as follows

::

 machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
 login your_earthdata_id
 password your_earthdata_password
 

.. attention::
  You are now ready for your first fire simulation, continue with :doc:`quickstart`.
