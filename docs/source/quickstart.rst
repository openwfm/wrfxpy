Quickstart
**********

.. important::

  It is imperative that a working WRF-SFIRE installation is available.
  Please first follow the installation instructions :doc:`installation`.
  


First fire forecast
===================

The simplest way to start is to invoke the standalone script

::

  ./simple_forecast.sh


The script will ask you a series of questions with sensible defaults and at the
end will create a JSON configuration file and finish with instructions on how to
run the simulation.


Example fire forecast
=====================

To perform a fire forecast, the script ``forecast.sh`` has to be executed with
a JSON configuration file as an argument, for example:

::

  ./forecast.sh <json-configuration-file>

An example configuration script is ``examples/simple_fire.json``, also listed here for
convenience.  The script has most of the values filled out but there are some placeholders.

Please set the following values:

  * ``geogrid_path`` should point to the directory with your WPS-GEOG data
  * ``num_nodes`` are the number of nodes to use for the parallel job
  * ``ppn`` the number of processors per node to use
  * ``wall_time_hrs`` number of hours of wall time to reserve for the job
  * ``qsys`` the queueing subsystem id which point into ``etc/clusters.json``

This example configuration runs a fire simulation with the following settings:

  - a single domain configuration with a domain placed approximately around an ignition point 
  - use `NAM <http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/nam/>`_ as the source for initial and boundary conditions
  - start at time now minus 30 mins and run a 5 hour simulation
  - use 10 nodes, 12 CPU cores per node, allow a wall time of 3 hrs, the queue manager is ``SGE`` (Sun Grid Engine)
  - use the default WPS/WRF/fire/emissions namelists as base
  - ignite the fire 600s after the start of the simulation and deactivate the ignition after 4 minutes.
  - generate surface temperature maps, wind information and fire fields for domain 1, the where the fire is burning
